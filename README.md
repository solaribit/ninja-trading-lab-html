**Live Demo** ? https://solaribit.github.io/ninja-trading-lab-html/projection-calculator.html (add this once you enable GitHub Pages)

## What is this?

A **single, zero-dependency HTML file** that contains the exact same beautiful compounding calculator you now have as a WordPress plugin – but you can open it anywhere:

- Drop it on any web server
- Host it on GitHub Pages (free)
- Embed via `<iframe>`
- Share the link with anyone – works offline too (after first load)

Perfect for Notion pages, link-in-bio sites, newsletters, or just giving someone a quick calculator without installing WordPress.

## Features (exactly the same as the plugin)

- Live exchange rates (USD ? ZAR ? GBP ? EUR) via ExchangeRate-API (free tier, no key required)
- 12-month & custom projections
- Weekly/monthly top-ups
- Gorgeous interactive Chart.js graph
- Reset button, quick presets (12m / 24m / 5y)
- 100% responsive (mobile-first)
- Works completely offline after first load (rates cached in localStorage)
